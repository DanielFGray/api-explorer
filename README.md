# api-helper

## Dependencies

* [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) for sending data
* [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) *[optional]* for pretty-printing output and `--json` support (explained below)

## Why

* Many API tasks require sending the same headers or data with every request
* Typing (or digging through your shell history for) the same options is tedious
* You want to be able to save API requests (to your shell rc for example) without leaking your auth tokens everywhere
* Using `curl --config` is clunky

## Usage

```
usage: api [-vh] <profile> <action> <endpoint> [...data]
```

* `profile` is the name of a file in `~/.config/api-helper` containing a URL entry and arbitrary curl options
* `action` is an http verb like `get`, `put`, `post`, etc
* `endpoint` is a route to be appended to the `url` defined in the `profile`
* `data` are curl options like `--data`  to be sent with the request

There are three levels of verbosity:
* `-v` will print the curl command to stderr
* `-vv` will show the curl transfer status (by disabling `--silent`)
* `-vvv` will call curl with `--verbose`

Verbosity most be specified as the first argument.

## Quick tutorial

### GitHub

At minimum your profile should contain a URL entry:

```
~/.config/api-helper/github

url		https://api.github.com
```

You'll likely also want to add authentication.

The [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/guides/getting-started/) specifies you should provide an [access key](https://github.com/settings/tokens) as a header in the following form:

```
Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4
```

so in the config file you would add

```
header  Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4
```

You can now query the API a lot simpler:

```
api github get user
```

Which will execute

````
curl --request GET --header 'Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4' https://api.github.com/user
````

Everything after the first 3 arguments is passed directly to curl, so to pass data to the [API](https://developer.github.com/api/), you use curl's built-in methods.  
Creating a repo on GitHub is now as simple as:

```
api github post user/repos -d '{"name":"awesome_new_repo"}'
```

Or, with some fancy [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) magic:

```
api github post user/repos --json '.name="awesome_new_repo"'
```

`--json` is the only non-standard option currently provided, it's short-hand for `--data "$(jq -Mcn 'â€¦')"`

### GitLab

For [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/README.html), the process is similar. Create a file at `~/.config/api-helper/gitlab` and put a `url` in there:

```
url  https://gitlab.com/api/v4/
```

The [auth for GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/README.html#authentication) is only slightly different:

```
header  PRIVATE-TOKEN: 9koXpg98eAheJpvBs5tK
```

You should create [personal access token](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens) on Gitlab specifically for this this use, rather than using your private token.

You can of course specify multiple `header` entries, if you want to add `sudo` for example.

You can now [create new projects on GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/projects.html#create-project) with

```
api gitlab post projects -d 'name=awesome_new_repo'
```

### Other

If the API you're using prefers HTTP auth you can specify a user in the config file: 

```
url   https://api.teknik.io/v1
user  user:password
```

Or if the API prefers it as a plain data key:

```
url   http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/
data  api_key=dfd71eb15d3d76069d85617de769872a
data  format=json
```

All of these options are taken from `man curl`; if you can pass it as an argument to `curl` you can save it as an option in the config file. Config files should be a sub-set of `curl` profiles described in the man page (I plan on a rewrite possibly in Perl that will allow full compatibility with existing profiles).

## Shell Integration

A small shell function can be added to your `bashrc` that will allow you to access the response as the variable `$res` in your shell:

``` bash
api() {
  local output
  res=$(command api "$@")
  echo "$res"
}
```

Or if you'd like automatic pretty printing with `jq`:

``` bash
api() {
  local json
  res=$(command api "$@")
  if json=$(jq -C '.' <<< "$res" 2> /dev/null); then
    echo "$json"
  else
    echo "$res"
  fi
}
```

### Example Usage

``` bash
$ api github get repos/danielfgray/api-helper/issues
$ jq -r '.[] | "\(.title)"' <<< "$res"
```
